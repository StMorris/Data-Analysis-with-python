## Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a supervised Machine Learning technique that is used to analyze and predict the polarity of sentiments within a text (either positive or negative).
- Polarity is a float which lies in the range of [-1,1] where 1 means positive statement and -1 means a negative statement. 
- Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgment whereas objective refers to factual information. 
Subjectivity is also a float which lies in the range of [0,1]
