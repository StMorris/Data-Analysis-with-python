# Uber Pick-ups New York Data Analysis

Two different data was analysed, the first data contains over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and the other contains 14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015. 




### Data


Uber Data from FiveThirtyEight: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data

### Brief 

- The analysis tells us how specific latitude and longitude tend to use Uber every time of the day. 
- We can also see the activity levels of people at different hours and how that varies by day. 
For example, the plots show that the Uber pickup patterns of people are very similar across weekdays. On the weekend, however, people are much more active on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings, but tend to call for fewer  pick-ups during evenings to night on Sundays and Mondays. 
- Also, the 31st of months tend to have fewer pick-ups as well. From the spatial analysis, midtown manhattan tend to have more rush that other parts of New york.



### Results

#### Pickups seem to be at peak during the evening of the day, when people are logging off from work, specifically, *17:00 Hrs*
