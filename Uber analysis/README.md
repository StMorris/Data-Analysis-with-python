### Analysis

The analysis tells us that specific latitude and longitude tend to use Uber more, regardless of time or day. We can additionally see the activity levels of people at different hours and how that varies by day. For example, the plots show that the Uber pickup patterns of people are very similar across weekdays. On the weekend, however, people are much more active on Saturday nights (and Sunday mornings), but tend to call for fewer  pick-ups during evenings to night on Sundays and Mondays. Also, the 31st of months tend to have fewer pick-ups as well. From the spatial analysis, midtown manhattan tend to have more rush that other parts of New york.
